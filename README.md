# Breast-Cancer-Detection-SVM
This project utilizes the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for breast cancer detection. It analyzes medical data to classify tumors as benign or malignant based on key features. By leveraging SVM's ability to handle high-dimensional data, the model enhances diagnostic accuracy, aiding early detection and improving patient outcomes.(The SVM algorithm creates a hyperplane to segregate n-dimensional space into classes and identify the correct category of new data points. The extreme cases that help create the hyperplane are called support vectors, hence the name Support Vector Machine.)
