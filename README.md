# Breast-Cancer-Detection-SVM
This project utilizes the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for breast cancer detection. It analyzes medical data to classify tumors as benign or malignant based on key features. By leveraging SVM's ability to handle high-dimensional data, the model enhances diagnostic accuracy, aiding early detection and improving patient outcomes.
